    <p>Mango trees are deep-rooted, symmetrical evergreens that attain heights of 90 feet and widths of 80 feet.
      Mango trees have simple alternate lanceolate leaves that are 12 to 16 inches in length and yellow-green, purple,
      or copper in color when young. Mature leaves are leathery, glossy, and deep green in color. New leaves arise in
      terminal growth flushes that occur several times a year.</p><p> Mature terminal branches bear pyramidal flower panicles
      that have several hundred white flowers that are about a 1/4 inch wide when open. Most of the flowers function as
      males by providing pollen, but some are bisexual and set fruit.
      Pollination is by flies, wasps, and bees.</p>
